Ecentria REST Bundle
=========================

Goal of this bundle is to simplify process of creating APIs with Symfony. We use already well-coded libraries, combine
them together to simplify process and not to re-invent the wheel. We've chose REST and HATEOS to have unified standards
of API requests and responses.
